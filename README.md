# 🛠️ ServiceNow IT Support Ticket Portfolio

This repository contains a set of realistic, simulated IT support tickets created using the ServiceNow developer instance (Classic UI). Each ticket reflects common incidents and service requests a Service Desk Analyst or IT Support Technician would handle in a real work environment.

This project demonstrates my understanding of ITSM practices, ServiceNow workflows, troubleshooting skills, and professional communication — all of which are essential for success in a support role.
